first we create the a process and let it wait for 300 seconds, and let it run in the background like the last exercise, 
then we search for all the processes that are "sleeping" using ps aux, to search for a specific keyword we use "grep" and then "sleep"
which will show us the process we just started, sleep 300.
we then kill the process, since ps aux, showed us the PID of the sleep 300.
then we recheck if the process has been terminated successfully or not by doing "ps aux | grep sleep" again.
