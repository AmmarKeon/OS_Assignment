this tast wanted to try the linking process on the operating system.
so i changed the "hello from file1" to "farewell from file1".
and in the screenshots folder there is a picture with the previous link,
and the new linking, also copied the files to the task folder, and then edited file1.c
and then made the object file and ran it.

proving that the linker works between both files, even after modification.
